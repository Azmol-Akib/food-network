          <p>
            Prepare all the vegetables and chicken as above and toast the sesame
            seeds ready for later. Part cook the broccoli in boiling water then
            cool with cold water. Prepare the sauce by putting all the
            ingredients in a jar and shaking vigorously. Bring a pot of water to
            boil, season the water and put the noodles in. Put your wok onto a
            high heat and add the vegetable oil. Allow the oil to get extremely
            hot before adding the chicken and stirring quickly with a wooden
            spoon.

          <h4>Split Pea Dhal</h4>
          <p>
            Prepare all the Dhal ingredients as above. Take a medium sized
            saucepan and heat the vegetable oil, add the onions and garlic and
            cook until golden brown. Add the garam masala, chilli powder and
            turmeric, cooking for a further minute. Add the chilli and gently
            cook for another 30 seconds. Add the chopped tomatoes, vegetable
            stock and split peas. Bring up to the boil, turn down to a simmer
            and cook until the split peas are tender (usually around 30
            minutes). You should have a thick consistency.

          <h4>Melanzane Parmiga</h4>
          <p>
            Pre heat oven to near max temp. Slice aubergines and lay on oiled
            baking sheet. Brush each slice with olive oil and sprinkle with
            salt. Do not overlap so may need 2 or 3 trays or cook in batches.
            When oven is really hot, cook slices for approx. 15/20 mins until
            they have changed colour and slightly brown. (There is no need to
            fry slices or salt them). When all slices have been cooked set to
            one side and gather the rest of the ingredients and a pyrex/baking
            dish.
